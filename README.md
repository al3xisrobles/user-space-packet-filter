# Fast User-Space Network Packet Filter for HFT

## Overview

This project aims to build a **high-performance, user-space network packet filter** optimized for **low-latency trading environments**. Traditional network packet filtering solutions rely heavily on kernel-space processing, introducing unnecessary **context switch overhead, system call latency, and buffer copying inefficiencies**. By bypassing the kernel’s traditional networking stack and implementing **user-space packet filtering**, this project will explore the **fundamental trade-offs in networking performance** and **HFT infrastructure optimizations**.

### Key Features:
- **Zero-copy packet capture** using AF_PACKET, PF_RING, or a similar mechanism.
- **Optimized filtering pipeline** to discard unwanted packets with minimal latency.
- **Batch processing and SIMD optimizations** to enhance throughput.
- **Kernel bypass techniques** (io_uring, DPDK, or XDP) for further speed improvements.

## Introduction

In high-frequency trading (HFT), **nanoseconds matter**. Every microsecond of delay between **receiving market data** and **placing an order** can determine profitability. As a result, **packet filtering efficiency is critical**—traders must process high-velocity financial data feeds in **real-time**, without waiting for the operating system’s traditional networking stack to handle incoming packets. 

This project will implement a **high-performance user-space packet filter**, which skips the overhead of **system calls, kernel context switches, and buffer copies**. The standard **Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)** and its successor, **eBPF/XDP**, provide efficient in-kernel packet filtering, but even these approaches suffer from context switch penalties. Instead, user-space solutions such as **AF_PACKET (mmap-based packet capture), PF_RING, io_uring, and DPDK** provide direct access to network interfaces, enabling microsecond-scale packet processing.

The core idea behind this implementation is to:
1. **Capture packets directly in user space** using a kernel-bypass approach.
2. **Filter packets efficiently** using a minimal processing pipeline, potentially leveraging **SIMD (AVX, SSE)** to maximize CPU parallelism.
3. **Batch process packets** to avoid the syscall overhead of per-packet operations.

By implementing this system, we explore a fundamental question: **How can modern OS and hardware features be leveraged to build ultra-low-latency trading infrastructure?**
